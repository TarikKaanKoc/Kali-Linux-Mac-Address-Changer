# Kali Linux Mac address changer
- Mac address renewal/changing tool.
 
### What's a MAC Address and how do I find it?

- Just like each house has it's own postal address, every device connected on a network
has a Media Access Control (MAC) address, that uniquely identifies it. The MAC address is tied to the Network Interface Controller (NIC), a subcomponent of the larger device. The NIC is where you make your physical connection to the network, by plugging in an Ethernet cable or connecting to a WiFi signal.

---
### What does a MAC address look like?

- The MAC address is a 12 digit hexadecimal number that is most often displayed with a colon or hypen separating every two digits (an octet), making it easier to read.

> Example:

```console

 A MAC address of 2c549188c9e3 is typically displayed as 2C:54:91:88:C9:E3 or 2c-54-91-88-c9-e3.

```

### Can a device have more than one MAC address?

- Yes. For each network interface in your device, there is a unique MAC address associated with it. So if your laptop has both an Ethernet port and Wi-Fi built-in, you will see two MAC addresses in the system configuration.

### How do I find my MAC address?

- In general, you will find MAC addresses in the system settings, general information, or network settings/status of your device. Occasionally, the MAC address is printed on a label affixed to the bottom of a device.

It is important to note that manufacturers sometimes use different names to describe the MAC address, such as Hardware ID, Physical Address, Wireless ID, Wi-Fi Address, etc.


#### For Windows Computers

1. Press Start + R on your keyboard
2. In the Run window, type in cmd and click OK
3. At the command prompt, type ipconfig /all and hit Enter
4. The MAC address for each interface will be listed as Physical Address
5. For wired interfaces, look for the term Ethernet or Gigabit in the name or description
6. For wireless interfaces, look for the terms Wireless or Wi-Fi in the name or description

#### For Mac Computers

1. Open System Preferences
2. Click on the Network icon
3. Select the interface you wish to use, then click Advanced...
4. The MAC address is listed under the Hardware tab
